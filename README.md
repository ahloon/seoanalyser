Other checkboxs function:
This is a URL - to flag the content of the textbox as a URL. I've not found a better way to check and validate this programmatically.
Calculate in page - to count the occurence of each word in the text box or website.
Calculate in Meta tag - to count the occurrence of each work in Meta tags in the textbox or website.
Calculate external Links - to count the occurrence of external links in the textbox or website.

# Installation guide
Build and run from Visual Studio 2017.

# To do
1. Getting words and meta tags from a website is not working at this moment. The challenge is getting the fetch API to work with URL in its parameter.
2. Getting external links is not working at this moment. Same problem as above.
3. Result table doesn't sort properly.
